## Hi there 👋
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a Computer Science student at Oregon State University with a deep interest in coding, problem-solving, and web development. My journey in technology is driven by curiosity and a desire to innovate and create impactful solutions.

## 👀 My Interests

My primary focus is web development, where I lean towards focusing on back-end technologies, but also spend some time creating user interfaces on the front-end as well. I enjoy designing and implementing scalable, robust, and secure applications. I've also spent some time working with lower-level programming in Assembly and C.

Right now, I'm currently focusing on deepening my knowledge of Java and gaining some familiarity with the Spring Boot framework. 

## 🧑‍💻 Projects and Contributions

Throughout my academic career, I've worked on several projects that showcase my skills and interests. From building full-stack web applications to implementing command line tools, I love applying my knowledge to real-world problems. Some of my biggest projects are pinned on my profile: take a look!

## 🛠️ Skills

    Languages: JavaScript, Python, Java, x86 Assembly, C, Rust
    Frameworks and Tools: React, Node.js, Spring Boot, Git, OpenMP
    Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB

## 🖇️ Let's Connect!

I'm always excited to connect with fellow developers, collaborate on interesting projects, or just have a chat about technology. Feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-joseph-anderson/)!
