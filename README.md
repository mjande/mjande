## Hi there üëã
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a Computer Science student at Oregon State University with a deep interest in coding, problem-solving, and web development. My journey in technology is driven by curiosity and a desire to innovate and create impactful solutions.

## üëÄ My Interests

My primary focus is web development, where I lean towards focusing on back-end technologies, but also spend some time creating user interfaces on the front-end as well. I enjoy designing and implementing scalable, robust, and secure applications. I've also spent some time working with lower-level programming in Assembly and C.

Right now, I'm currently focusing on deepening my knowledge of Java and gaining some familiarity with the Spring Boot framework. 

## üßë‚Äçüíª Projects and Contributions

Throughout my academic career, I've worked on several projects that showcase my skills and interests. From building full-stack web applications to implementing command line tools, I love applying my knowledge to real-world problems. Some of my biggest projects are pinned on my profile: take a look!
